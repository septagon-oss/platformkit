# Task module

`modules/task` is the reference module: one entity, a `rest.Spec` at
`/api/v1/task/tasks` guarded by `task:read` and `task:update`, explicit
lifecycle commands, an optional tenant-qualified policy check and the SLA
sweep job. Read [module.go](module.go) for the manifest, [contracts/](contracts/)
for the entity, service, events, permissions and the
[conformance suite](contracts/tasktest/), and [domain/](domain/README.md) for
the resolution rule that needs no runtime.

Its SQL is [migrations/](migrations/), embedded and exported as
`task.Migrations`; the manifest hands the kernel the same files, and a test
composes it with `dbtest.Schema(t, task.Migrations)`.

Compose it with `task.Deps{Service, Policy, Tenants, SweepEvery}`; `Policy` is
optional and [modules/auth/policies](../auth/policies/README.md) shows the
Topaz adapter. The generated admin screens appear at `/admin/task/tasks` with
no code of the module's own. `make test TEST_PACKAGES=./modules/task/...`
needs the development database; the domain package's tests need nothing.
